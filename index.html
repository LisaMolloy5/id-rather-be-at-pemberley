            <p>

                Do you love Jane Austen? Could you spend hours debating that Colin Firth is the best Darcy or
                that the 2005 Pride and Prejudice is actually the best adaptation of this classic book
                then you came to the right place.
                We are an online book club who meet review books all about regency and romance. Everyone is welcome
                whether you know every character in Sense and Sensibility
                or if you don't know your Mr.Tilneys from you Mr. Knightleys.
                Every month we pick a new title to read and then meet on the first wednesday of every month for a nice
                chat over zoom.
                We are based in Dublin but no matter where in the world you are we invite you to give your opinions on
                all things regency.
                Head over to our join page and become apart of this great club.
